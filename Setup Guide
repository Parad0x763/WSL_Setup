First step is to install wsl by using this command in PowerShell: 
  wsl --install
I'd reccommend using the Windows Terminal which comes preinstalled on Windows 11 but if can be installed via the Windows Store on Windows 10

Next you will need to set up your user info, a username and a password. The username should be in all lowercase.
You may need to install Ubuntu through the Microsoft Store, just search Ubuntu in the store and download your version of choice.

Some useful commands:
  wsl -l --running //shows what distro(s) is running
  wsl --shutdown //to shutdown the virtual machine
  wsl --update //to update wsl
  
Once wsl is installed and updated and you have Ubuntu installed, you can launch into ubuntu by opening PowerShell and typing 'ubuntu' and hittng enter
You can also set up GUI applications in wsl, but that can take some more set up, though you can install applications through the ubuntu bash terminal
and then launch those applications via the command line as you would in a Linux distro

For setting up an actual GUI environment for Ubuntu: (Run these commands via Ubuntu)
  
  First: sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
  
  Next: sudo apt-get install -y kubuntu-desktop  You will be prompted with a screen just hit ok, 
    then on the next screen: Configuring sddm, select 'lightdm', this may take a while just let it finish running
  
  Then run these commands:
    sudo apt-get install xrdp
    sudo cp /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini.bak
    sudo sed -i 's/3389/3390/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
    sudo sed -i 's/max_bpp=32/#max_bpp=32\nmax_bpp=128/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
    sudo sed -i 's/xserverbpp=24/#xserverbpp=24\nxserverbpp=128/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
  
  Lastly: enable Dbus:
    #enable dbus
    sudo systemctl enable dbus
    sudo /etc/init.d/dbus start
    sudo /etc/init.d/xrdp start
    # check xrdp status
    sudo /etc/init.d/xrdp status
    
 Now launch into a Remote Desktop Connection, search Remote in the start menu, and under the Computer: section enter
    localhost:3390
 once connected input your username and password created earlier and you should be running an Ubuntu desktop in Windows via WSL!
